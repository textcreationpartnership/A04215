            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PVBLISHER TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
                  <p>ABout Three Yeeres ſince, Maiſter Iacob hauing ſome ſpeach with certen of the ſeparation before mentioned, concerning their peremptory &amp; vtter ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Churches of England, was requeſted by them, briefly to ſétt down in wryting, his Reaſon for defence of the ſaid Churches, And they would either yeild vnto his proofes, or procure an anſwer vnto the ſame. Wherevpon, the Argument following this Preface, was ſet downe in wryting by Maiſter Iacob: which the ſaid parties did ſend to Maiſter Fr. Iohnſon, being then priſoner in the Clinke in Southwark, who made an anſwer vnto the ſame, conteyning 3. Exceptions and 9. Reaſons in denyall of the Aſſumption: Wherevnto Maiſter Iacob Replyed. Afterward Maiſter Iohnſon defended his ſaid Exceptions and Reaſons: And finally, Maiſter Iacob Replyed againe. As by the particulars themſelues appeareth.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing weighed and conſidered with my ſelfe, the great ignorance and errors, wherewith thoſe of the ſeparation aforeſaid, are and haue bene lately carried awaye: namely, to affirme, <hi>That all that ſtande members of the Churches of Englande, are no true Chriſtians, nor in ſtate of ſaluation,</hi> And ſuch like moſt vngodly ſentences, which would grieue any Chriſtian ſoule once to thinke on, much more to publiſh to the view of the world: And weighing likewiſe withall, the greate weakenes of manie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians among vs, who (through want of experience, or due conſideration of things as they are) may eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by their deluſions be drawne away into thoſe errors with them: I haue therefore: (Aſwell in hope of reclaiming of the ſaid parties from their ſaid extremities, (which now I iudge the moſt of them, for want of meanes ſee not:) As alſo for the ſtaying of others from running into the ſame grieuous exceſſe with them) now publiſhed this diſcourſe to the view of the world, which hath line buryed in the hands of ſome few. Many being deſirous of it, who by reaſon of the largnes in wryting out of the ſame could not obteyne it: Wherevnto I am ſo much the rather induced, For that the Reaſons herein by Maiſter Iacob alleadged, haue (by Gods bleſſing) reclaymed many from their former errors, and ſatisfied others, who haue bene doubtfull, and ſubiect to fall into the ſame.</p>
                  <p>In the examining of which Diſcourſe, I ſhall deſire the Reader to obſerue a few notes for his better proffiting in the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And Firſt, (among the reſt) to note this, as a token of the ſtrange and obſtinate dealing of Maiſter Iohnſon and others of them, viz. That heretofore, (vntill ſuch time as the Argument hereafter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was framed aganſt them,) they neuer denyed, That the doctrine and profeſſion of the Churches of England, was ſufficient to make thoſe that beleeued and obeyed them, to be true Chriſtians, and in ſtate of ſaluation: But alwayes held, profeſſed and acknowledged the contrarie: As by the publike confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of themſelues, namely Maiſter Barrow, Maiſter Penry, and Maiſter Iohnſon himſelfe, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe mentioned in Pag. 81. appeareth: But nowe, they ſeing; That if they ſhould acknowledge the ſaid Doctrines and profeſſion, to be ſufficient to ſaluation: That then this concluſion would of neceſſitie follow, <hi>that thoſe that hold and practize the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are a true</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Which yet Maiſter Penry confeſſed, ſee Pag. 82.</note> 
                     <hi>Church,</hi> And ſo their own former iudgements ſhould be croſſed. Rather I ſay then they would be drawne to that, They nowe ſtick not to deny their owne confeſſions (which they thinke to be the ſaifeſt way for them,) and like vnnaturall children, ſo vehemently hate, contemne, and diſpiſe their mother who bare them, nouriſhed, and brought them vp: from whoſe breſts they ſucked that ſweete milke of the meanes of euerlaſting life and ſaluation, (if euer they had any taſt of it at all.) Beeing notwithſtanding, not abaſhed nowe in a deſperate manner, in the hardnes of their heart, to affirne:<note n="*" place="margin">Which appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth, generally by denying the Aſſumption of Ma. Iacobs, &amp; particularly in theſe pages 13. 62. 63. 64.</note> 
                     <hi>That none by the doctrine of the Churches of England, can be a true Chriſtian, or ſaued: But that they all worſhip God in vaine, Are aboliſhed from Chriſt, Are Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Idolaters, departers from the faith, worſe then Infidels;</hi> And ſuch like moſt vnchriſtian ſentences, making them all one with the Church of Rome, &amp;c. Which impious affirmations, would cauſe any Chriſtian heart to lament and bleed for grief; Whoſe vnchriſtian ſentences, and falſe and deceiptfull Reaſons, (the very naming whereof were ſufficient to refute them,) are moſt plainly taken awaye, and cleane ouerthrowne, by theſe brief Replies of Maiſter Iacob vnto euery of them, vnto which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre yow. Onely this I adde with all, which I would deſire might be noted: That if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in their former confeſſions, That the doctrines and profeſſion of the Churches of England are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſaluation; (As they ought, it being the very truth) Then are they all in a moſt grieuous ſchiſme, in ſo peremptorily condempning, and ſeparating, from ſuch true Chriſtians and Churches. And if they deny it: (as they haue begonne to doe:) Then doe they runne headlong, into an intollerable ſinne and extremitie, without all warrant of Gods word: And beſides giue iuſt occaſion to be called fearfull<note n="*" place="margin">Which name they vniuſtly giue to thoſe, that iuſtly for this their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity forſake their fellowſhip</note> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, in ſo wholy falling (and that aduiſedly, for aduantage ſake, as it ſeemeth plainely to appeare) from ſo notable a truth which before they imbraced, and acknowledged.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:7940:3"/>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, I would deſier the Reader not to be carried away with the multitude of corruptions, from the Queſtion or matter in hand, (viz. Whether the good doctrines of the Churches of England are ſufficient to ſaluation in them that in ſimplicitie of heart beleeue and imbrace them, notwithſtanding the multitude of errors and corruptions which Maiſter Iohnſon repeateth to the contrarie:) But to haue an eſpeciall regard vnto the ſame. Which is the maine poinct that hath and doeth altogeather deceiue them, viz. To haue an eye to the corruptions in the Miniſterie, worſhip, and gouernement of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of England: But neuer to looke vnto the nature and force of them, whether <hi>ſimply</hi> of their owne nature, they ouerthrow faith and Chriſtianitie, or whether they be held of obſtinacy and a conuicted conſcience, or not. Therefore I pray you marke and examine the errors which they reckon vp, (and I deſire the ſame alſo of them, for whoſe good eſpecially I publiſhed this Treatiſe.) And after due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſee if thoſe errors are ſimplie of that nature which before we haue noted. If they be not, (as Maiſter Iohnſon nor all the men in the world, ſhall euer be able to proue they are:) Then doe they gett no aduantage by thoſe errors, to this purpoſe which they vrge them for, although they were Thrice as many<note n="*" place="margin">Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are too many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</note> more as they are. Thus they may ſee how they haue all this while ben deceiued, and are now to ſeeke a new for defence of their ſeparation. For I hope they will not ſay, That euery error, held in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie by Chriſtians, doth cut them off from ſaluation in Chriſt; Then ſhould they condempne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vnleſſe they hold Anabaptiſticall perfection, which ſurely though I thinke they hold it not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in their conſciences; Yet in their practize (by condempning others ſo peremtorily; that iump not euen with them in euery poinct) they come very neare it: But let this paſſe; wee ſee then, That of neceſſitie, the nature of the errors muſt be regarded, Euery ſinne is not a like. Me thinkes then, that they ſhould affoard that fauour to others, which they would haue others to offoard vnto them: namely, That as they would be accompted true Chriſtians, through their faith in Chriſt, notwithſtanding their errours (which they muſt acknowledge<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 19.12 1. Cor. 13.9.12</note> are infinite manie in this life.) So they ſhould accompt of others in the like caſe: which euen common ſence and humanitie would require them to graunt.</p>
                  <p>To impreſſe this thing a little better in their mindes, I will a little turne my ſpeech vnto them. And I would pray them, to call to minde the manie errors and corruptions which they beare with amonge themſelues, and lay them and the errors with vs togeather, and they ſhall ſee their equalitie.</p>
                  <p>Some of you, hold it vtterly and ſimply vnlawfull, to ſweare by a booke, to proue a will, take an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration or ſue in the Eccleſiaſticall Courts: To ſhut vp your ſhops vpon Holly dayes and Feſtiuall dayes, &amp;c. And that theſe are the inuentions of Antichriſt, &amp;c. And others of you, hold theſe thinges altogeather lawfull, and haue and doe put them in practiſe, with manie other ſuch like thinges which I could name. But theſe ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>Now the thing which I would from hence note is this. Can you among your ſelues beare with ſuch weighty poinctes as theſe, which you ſay are the inuentions &amp; traditions of Antichriſt that man of ſinne, which (in your accompt) are the<note n="†" place="margin">I would you knew the marks of the Beaſt a little better.</note> marks of the Beaſt,<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Reu.</hi> 14.</note> which who ſoeuer receiueth, ſhall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, and ſhalbe tormented in Hell fier for euer? And will not your ſtumackes ſerue you, to beare with the Churches of England, in the like, or rather in farr leſſer matters? What equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is there in this? Surely you are (for the moſt parte) ſo wholly giuen, and bend your wits and mindes ſo much, to looke into the eſtate of other men &amp; other Churches, &amp; to apply the ſcriptures to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: As you ſildome or neuer look into your own eſtate, or apply the ſcripturs to your ſelues: But looke vnto it, it will be your decay in th'end. You may ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by your own practize all errors are not alike: But yet, will ſome ſay,<label type="milestone">

                     </label> 
                     <hi>are not all the ſcriptures and commaundements of God fundamentall, and to be obeyed alike? &amp;c.</hi>

                     </label> Let ſuch conſider of this ſcripture 1. Cor. 3.12.15. amongſt many other: which plainly proueth, that many errors (ſo they be not of obſtinacie) may be built by a Chriſtian vpon the <hi>fundation</hi> Chriſt Ieſus, and yet be a true Chriſtian ſtill: For which ſee further Maiſter Iacobs anſwer in Pag. 88. Againe there are errors <hi>ſimply fundamentall,</hi> which of their owne nature cleane aboliſh from Chriſt; ſuch are the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Arians</hi> concerning the Deitie of Chriſt: of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> concerning his humanitie: of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> concerning Iuſtification by workes, praying to, and truſting in Saincts, and ſuch like, which directly raze the very fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation. But that any one, or all, of the errors in the Churches of England are of this force (as you would ſeeme to hold by all your 9.

                  <p>Thus much concerning the nature of our errors, whether they be of obſtinacie, or againſt the fundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on directly: Which is the Second note I deſire to be obſerued.</p>

As by the example of the Iewiſh Churches in the times of the Prophets, eſpecially of Chriſt him ſelfe, may plainly appeare. The Euangeliſtes make mention in diuers places, <hi>That they worſhipped God in vaine, teaching for doctrine mens preceptes. They made their proſelites the Children of Hell Two fold more then they were before. They made the commaundements of God of none effect by their traditions. Such as beleeued in Chriſt they excommunicated, &amp;c.</hi> Yet were they a true Church, notwithſtanding theſe, and many other grieuous enormities: with whom Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles, had communion and fellowſhip, ſometime in thoſe good things that were among them. And ſo might they with the Churches of England, without iuſtifying or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, which they ſee to be euill. All which things doe more fully appeare in the conference it ſelfe, as it followeth hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But vnto the examples of theſe Churches, me thinkes I heare already that common anſwer and laſt refuge of theirs: which is this. <label type="milestone">

If we ſhould examine the ſame, we ſhould finde that it was as greatly altered and corrupted, as is the conſtitution of the Churches of England. Two high Prieſts hauing by ſimony crept in at once, which was vnlawfull, and contrarie to Gods ordinance, (notwithſtanding their gloſes in their other<note n="“" place="margin">9 Reaſons.</note> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, to allow them to be lawfull by<note n="*" place="margin">2. Chron. 24.2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> and by<note n="“" place="margin">2. King 25.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Seruiah</hi> the chief Prieſte, &amp; <hi>Zephaniah</hi> the Second: which make againſt themſelues:) For there was neuer but one high Prieſt, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7940:4"/>they confeſſe<note n="*" place="margin">Anſwere to Maiſter Hild. Pag. 50.</note> (Ergo not two as here were) the reſt were indeed inferior to him: And yet amongſt thoſe, there was a chiefty alſo, who were called, ſometimes Second Prieſtes, or Prieſtes of the Second order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. King. 23.4. and ſometimes chief Prieſts, Mat. 27.1. Theſe ſcriptures being compared with thoſe in the margin by them cited, doe make it more plaine. Now, if the chief offices, were ſo corrupted and altered through couetouſnes, as the Hiſtories make mention: It is not likely, that the inferior offices did remaine ſound, but were aſmuch or more altered: The Prieſts (generally) being ſuch couetous wicked perſons, their offices beeing very gainefull: and beſides they liuing vnder the authoritie of the Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Romans, who ruled ouer them. All theſe things conſidered, it is very likely that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offices &amp; outward conſtitution (on which they ſo much depend) were wholy altered from the right inſtitution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would make nothing for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for their allegation of Mat. 23.1. Where they ſay, Chriſt teſtifieth that they had true offices, by ſaying they ſatt in Moſes chaire: It will not help them, any whit at all. For Moſes was no Prieſt, as they were, but a Magiſtrate: and therefore Moſes chaire muſt be vnderſtood of ſome what elſe: &amp; themſelues<note n="*" place="margin">Maist. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Mai. Greenwood, in diuers Letters and Treatiſes.</note> haue vnderſtood it heretofore, of Moſes doctrine. 2. Secondly (to let their conſtitution paſſe, which yet as I haue ſaid, would be found as badde or worſe then ours) wee will examine their corruptions in doctrine: Wherein I would know of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are the greater ſinnes, of theſe two ſorts, viz.
<list>
                        <item>1. A falſe and corrupt outward conſtitution:</item>
                        <item>2. Or falſe and corrupt doctrines.</item>
                     </list>
I thinke they will ſay, the corrupt and falſe doctrines are the greater, as they are indeed: For that they, doe wound, feſter and corrupt the very conſcience, and doe deceiue the hearers thereof, Whereas the errors in the conſtitution of a Church, (eſpecially in ſome circumſtances (as the errors with vs are) and thoſe of no ſmall controuerſie, in matters alſo not fundamentall) are nothing nere ſo hurtfull: by howe much the Tithing of Mint, Annis, and Commin, are of leſſer force then the other weightier matters of the law. Now from hence, I Reaſon thus.</p>
                  <p>If the greater ſinnes (namely in doctrine) doe not ſimply ouerthrow a companie of Chriſtians, from being a true Church: Then much leſſe will the leſſer ſinnes (namely in the outward conſtitution, &amp;c.)</p>
                  <p>But the falſe doctrines (which are the greater ſinnes) themſelues confeſſe by the example of the ſaid, Churches doe not. Therefore neither will the leſſer.</p>
                  <p>For the better explayning of this poinct, I would pray them reſolue me of this queſtion. What if a company of <hi>Arians, Anabaptiſtes.</hi> or <hi>Papiſtes,</hi> ſhoud bee gathered and eſtabliſhed in a true outward conſtitution, and ſtill reteyne their fundamentall errors before<note n="“" place="margin">pag. 4.</note> named: Whether ſhould their outward conſtitution make them a true Church, yea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> no? I thinke they will ſay no. Thus I hope then it appeareth, That the outward conſtitution whether falty or true, availeth nothing to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing or making of a true Church, vnleſſe other doctrines of the foundation, either falſe or true, doe concurre therewith. And thus their Obiection of the Iewiſh conſtitution, is (I truſt) fully anſwered: So that ſtill their peremptory ſeparation and condempning of the Churches of England, for ſome outward corruptions, temayneth ſtill a grieuous ſinne vpon their heades: for which (without harty repentance) they ſhall one day anſwer before God, which will be too heauie a burthen for them to beare.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, concerning our corruptions: As we cannot iuſtifie them to be no corruptions, (but muſt needes acknowledge, that there are many yet remaining in our land, which were left by that man of ſinne &amp; are as thornes vnto our ſides,<note place="margin">Iudg. 2.3.</note> which we hope God will in time aboliſh): So dare we not runne into your extremities, to condempne our Churches for ſuch corruptions, but waight the appoincted time of God for the redreſſe thereof. Yet in the meane time, ſo longe as thoſe moſt excellent truthes and doctrines of ſaluation, (for which God make vs thankfull) are ſtill reteyned and held, as ſoundly as by any Church vpon the face of the earth (the other errors not ſimply ouerthrowing the ſame, beeing not held of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, and being alſo for the moſt parte, of great controuerſie and diſputation amonge the learned:) So long I ſay, communion in things lawfull, is to be kept with them, as before is noted in the example of other Churches: Otherwiſe, it will come to paſſe, (by reaſon of the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 25.13. to 23.</note> diuerſitie in opinions and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes which by the corruption of our nature we remaine in, in this tabernacle, as hath<note n="“" place="margin">Leu. 4. Pſal. 19.12.</note> bene in all ages, and<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9, 12.</note> ſhalbe, ſo long as this life of imperfection indureth,) that no communion can euer bee had with any Church liuing, no nor any one Chriſtian with another: Which to affirme, were moſt abſurd and vngodly.</p>
                  <p>Theſe obſeruations beeing conſidered, I doubt not but the Lorde will adde a bleſſing to this worke, That ſuch as are ſimple hearted, and haue exceeded in eagerneſſe of zeale: may ſee their extremitie, in ſo raſhly and vnaduiſedly ſeparating from, and condempning the Churches of England, ſometimes their Nurſes and Mothers, as before is noted: Whereby God may haue the glory, and themſelues the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, euen the ſaluation of their ſoules through Chriſt.</p>

Either therefore the Propoſition is not generall, but admitteth limitations, and then is not the Argument good: Or if it bee generall, without any limitation, ſo as whatſoeuer be added too (or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with) that which otherwiſe might make a true Christian, or a true Church, yet it hindreth nothing at all: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not abſolutely true in ſuch vnderſtanding, as may appeare by the former exceptions, &amp; diuers other that might be alleadged.</hi>

                              <p>The Firſt of theſe, is our maine queſtion, and the grounde of all our reaſoning, which you gainſay. The Second, though it be not expreſlie ſpoken, yet it is directlie, euidently, and vndeniably concluded, by all &amp; euery of your arguments againſt vs. As in the ſeueralls hereafter we ſhal ſee. The Third, you are driuen vnto, for defence of your former Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which elſe falleth to the grounde. And this you affirme flatly in your defence of your 1.6. and 7. Reaſons.</p>
                              <p>Nowe my deſire is, that all men would take notice of theſe your 3: Aſſertions, and conſider indifferentlie, vvhether they proceede from an honeſt, a ſober, or a Chriſtian minde. And you M. Iohnſon, if you liſt hereafter to ſay any more, defende theſe 3. pointes directly and plainly, that your anſvveres may be briefer, and more certen, then now they are.</p>
                              <p>Novve I come to the particular examination of your former anſwerere.</p>
                              <p>Firſt you ſay, <hi>You omitted the Propoſition before, not for the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it, but only, becauſe you would ſee howe I meant it.</hi> Why? He that hath but halfe an eye, may ſee the meaning of thoſe vvordes, where is no darknes nor doubtfulnes of ſence at all. What fault finde you in it nowe? Forſooth, firſt a want in the Aſſumption, &amp; then vntruethes, both in the Propoſition, and Aſſumption of my Sillogiſme. There wanteth (you ſay) that I ſhould expreſſe in the Aſſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>That our Aſſemblies be companies gathered togeather in the doctrines &amp; ordinances which we all by lawe publiquely profeſſe and practiſe.</hi> Who but a wrangler would not vnderſtand that I meant ſo much? Nay doe not my expreſſe wordes imply aſmuch: vvhen I ſay, We by lavve publiquely profeſſe and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them? Then are not our Aſſemblies (vvhich are by lavv) gathered together in this profeſſion &amp; povver? Fy for ſhame, theſe are ſenceleſſe cauilations. But becauſe vvhat in me lyeth, I vvould not haue you any more to ſtumble at a ſtrawe, I haue to ſatisfie you vvithall,<note place="margin">Not that the Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound without this addition: But becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Reader may ſee howe you will play at a ſmal game ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſit out, vt aiunt.</note> novve added thoſe words to the Aſſumption aforeſaid in a contrarie letter which you deſire, viz. <hi>and our publike aſſemblies are therein gathered togeather.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Secondly, you ſay, that my propoſition meaneth, <hi>that what ſoeuer is held togeather and ioyned, with that which otherwiſe might make a true Chriſtian, or a true Church: Yet notwitſtanding they are ſo to be reputed, as if there were no ſuch additions or comixtures.</hi> O ſtrange dealing: in all my writing I haue no ſuch worde, no ſilable, no letter, ſounding to that ſence I haue directly contrary, in my anſwere to your Fourth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7940:7"/>as your ſelf noteth there. Yet yow M. <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> with out al ſhame, in the view of the world, doe Father on me this foule vntruth, and moſt ſenceleſſe errour, in your firſt entrance.</p>
                              <p>Further, where as it ſeemeth you reproue my Propoſion, requiring to to haue it ſet thus: Whatſoeuer is ſufficient to make a particuler man a true Chriſtian <hi>(and hath nothing added with it diſtroying the foundation of faith)</hi> That is ſufficient to make a company ſo gathered togither, a true Church.</p>
                              <p>You muſt know M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> that that were an idle &amp; vaine addition: for whereſoeuer there are any ſuch things added diſtroying faith, there whatſoeuer elſe ſeemeth ſufficient, indeed it is not ſufficient to make a true Chriſtian. Wherefore <hi>nodum in ſcirpo quaeris,</hi> this is to finde a knot in a ruſh. Thus much concerning the trunes of my Propoſition.</p>
                              <p>

                           <p>HOw fit or vnfit the ſaid diſcription of a viſible Church (mentioned in the <hi>19.</hi> Article of the ſaid book) is, we neither did, nor doe examine. Onely becauſe this is their owne profeſsion, and wee ſee their practiſe is contrary vnto it, we did therfore from hence take our firſt exception, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of them, to ſhew their aſſemblies to be ſuch, or els to know, that their own diſcription, is a witnes againſt themſelues.</p>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:7940:8"/>
                           <p>Now in their reply, haue they according to the particulers of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, iuſtified their Church-aſſemblies? nothing leſſe. Let this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be first obſerued. But what then haue they donne? Surely this. Firſt pretending as if they repeated our exception, and their owne diſcription, they leaue out diuers perticulers, of ſpeciall moment there expreſſed, as firſt, where the viſible Church is diſcribed, to bee <hi>a congregation of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men,</hi> they leaue out theſe wordes <hi>(of faithfull men)</hi> belike knowing that their Congregations, which are holds of all foule ſpirits, and cages of euery vncleane and hatefull bird,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.2.</note> cannot therefore iuſtly bee accoumpted congregations of faithfull men. Secondly, where the deſcription ſpeaketh, <hi>that the Sacraments be duely miniſtered:</hi> they leaue out the word <hi>(duely:)</hi> becauſe it croſſeth their womens Baptiſme, priuate Communion, receiuing of the moſt prophane and their ſeede, &amp;c. Laſtly, where in the deſcription it is reqaired, both for preaching the pure word and due adminiſtration of the Sacraments, that they be donne according to Chriſtes ordinance: they leaue out altogither theſe words <hi>(according to Chriſtes ordinance:)</hi> belike becauſe this clauſe quite ouerthroweth both their Antichriſtian Prelacy, from which all the inferior Miniſters amongſt them receiue power and authoritie to preach, and miniſter the Sacramentes, and their Prieſthood and Deaconery, wherein they all administer, and their ſtinted impoſed prayers, exhortations, croſſes on the forehead, queſtiones to the infantes, vſe of the ſame wordes in Engliſh in ministering the Lords ſupper, which the papiſts vſed and ſtill vſe in Latine, not reteyning the words of Chriſts inſtitution, and ſuch like.</p>
                           <p>Now thus hauing left out ſuch perticulers as were of ſpetiall moment againſt them, they next demaund <hi>wherein their practize is contrary to their profeſſion, and diſcription of a viſible Church, in what things that of neceſſitie are requiſite?</hi> We aunſwere, in all the particulers of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription aforeſaid.</p>
                           <p>For firste, their Church-aſſemblies, are not congregations of faithfull men, but a confuſion of all manner of people though neuer ſo wicked and prophane. The<note n="“" place="margin">D.

Finally, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be any thing amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſauing a ſound Christian. Theſe things being ſo, as both their estate and writings beare witneſſe: let themſelues iudge, whether their Aſſemblies can be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Congregations of faithfull men, or no: which is the first poinct of the deſcription aforeſaid.</p>
                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:7940:8"/>
                           <p>Secondly, in the ſame deſcription is required, <hi>That the pure worde of God be preached, according to Chriſtes ordinance.</hi> But amongst them, are allowed beſides the word of God, the Apocripha bookes: and in ſtead of preaching the worde, the reading of Homilies: as may appeare in that booke of Articles alleadged by themſelues. Yet who knoweth not, that in thoſe bookes, are diuers vntruthes, errors, contradictions, blaſphemies, and ſuch like? So farre are they from being the pure word of God, or agreeing therewith. Moreouer, when and where the worde is preached among them, it is done by vertue of a falſe office and calling, neuer appointed by Christ. And the Ministers that preach it, doe in their constitution ſtand alwayes ſubiect, to be ſilenced, ſuspended, excommunicated, and degraded by the Prelates and Ordinaries, to whom (when they are made Priestes,) they promiſe, and (when they enter vpon a benefice) they ſweare, Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obedience. Neither are they ſuffered any further to preach the word, and trueth of God, then agreeth with the Articles, Iniunctions, aduertice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and caueats, in that behalfe prouided. If any preach the worde of God anie further, they are ſubiect to be ſilenced, baniſhed, &amp; put to death. That theſe things accord with the ordinance of Chriſt, or with their owne deſcription of a viſible Church, we ſuppoſe themſelues will not for ſhame affirme it.</p>
                           <p>Laſtlie, in their deſcription it is required, <hi>That the Sacramentes bee duely miniſtred, according to the ordinance of Chriſt, in all things, that of neceſſitie are requiſite to the ſame.</hi> Nowe by the ordinance of Christ, in the adminiſtration of the Sacramentes, there are neceſſarilie required 1. A lawfull Miniſter. 2. A lawfull people. And thirdly, A lawfull adminiſtration, according to the Testament of Chriſt: In all which, their practize is conerarie to the ordinance of Christ, and their own deſcription aforeſaid. Their Miniſters all of them are either Prelates, Prieſtes, or Deacons (which amongſt them is a ſtep to the Prieſthood:) none of which Chriſt hath ordeyned in his Testament for the worke of his ministerie. Their people are not ſeparated from the world, but ſtande in confuſion with it, and in ſubiection to the Antichristian Prelates and Prelacie:<note place="margin">See Iohn. 15.19. &amp; 17.14.16. 1. Iohn. 4.5, 6 Act. 2.40. and 19.9. Reuel. 18.4. &amp; 14.9.</note> And therefore can not be deemed a true church of God, &amp; the people of Chriſt, vnto whom in ſuch estate the Sacraments (which are ſeales of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace) doe apperteyne, and may be adminiſtred. Finally, their administration is acçording to the inuentions and precepts of man, with ſtinted prayers, exhortations, Epiſtles and Gospels: and beſides thoſe in Baptiſme, croſſing on the forehead, &amp; queſtions to the infant: in the Lords ſupper, tranſlating, and vſing out of the Maſſe booke, other wordes then the wordes of Christes inſtitution, and ſuch like, as may bee ſeene at large in their booke of common prayer, which is picked and culled out of the

                           <p>Theſe things we haue ben forced thus to mention at large, both becauſe they twice demaund (as if they knewe not themſelues) wherein their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is contrarie to that deſcription aforeſaid: and becauſe they bluſh not to affirme, that all the Chriſtian world ſeeth and confeſſeth their practize to be aggreeable to their profeeſſion in that booke. Whereas the contrarie is most true.</p>
                           <p>Touching which, what themſelues haue heretofore written to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: See in the Admonitions to the Parleament, Replyes of T. C. againſt D. Whitguift, Demonſtration of Diſcipline, &amp;c, And what the reformed Churches profeſſe to the contrarie: ſee in the Frenche, Belgicke, and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetian Churches, and in the Harmonie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions, Sect. 10. &amp; 11. which would be too long to ſet downe at large in this place: Neither is it needfull, ſeeing it is moſt euident in the books and places alleadged, whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Reader.</p>
                           <p>Thus alſo it appeared, what iust cauſe wee had, to put them to proue their aſſemblies, to be ſuch, as themſelues diſcribe viſible Churches to bee: Which, ſeing they haue not yet done, and ſeing their practice is contrarie to their profeſſion, as now (at their requeſt) we haue ſhewed in the perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers aforeſaid: If they ſtill bee minded as before, wee doe alſo ſtill aſke, where and what are their proofes, touching the perticulers mentioned in their owne deſcription of a viſible Church.</p>

That which you bring of</hi> D. Whitgift <hi>and other writers amongſt vs of the prophaneſſe of many in our aſſemblies, you depraue their meaninges vtterlie: for though they graunt verie many ſuch to be amongſt vs, yet they ſay not, that all our aſſemblies are ſuch, nor our whole aſſemblies: Neither denie they our aſſemblies to be companies of faithfull men, or vtterly to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from: Nay, the contrarie doe they: euen that onely they ought to be reformed. Therefore you too groſſely abuſe them.</hi>

                           <hi>Secondly, The Article requireth the pure worde of God to be preached. But (ſay you) the Apocrypha books, &amp; reading of Homilies, &amp; other errors are allowed in our practize: Yea ſurely &amp; in our profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too as your ſelfe obſerueth in the book of Artic. yet then our profeſſion &amp; practiſe differ not, as you charg our Churches. But theſe poinctes are not the pure word of God: Neither

Onely it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that a viſible Church might not erre in any poinct, that of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is requiſite, as their wordes expreſſe. It reſteth then that you ſhew, that the pure word is not preached in our aſſemblies by law, ſufficiently to ſaluation: which yet you doe not, nor can doe. Therefore you ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7940:11"/>anſwerable likewiſe thervnto) euen as before time Maiſter</hi> Cranmer, Ridley Latimer, <hi>and ſuch like, with their Congregations did then: viz. That Chriſt is our Prophet, Prieſt and King, and to be obeyed in his own ordinances onely and in no other. This I ſay we generally profeſſe and practize. Howbeit this note with all, we hold Chriſts ordinance to be of two ſortes, written or vnwritten, the firſt neceſſary, the ſecond arbitrary, The firſte touching doctrine, that is, touching faith and the inward opinion only, ſuch as theſe, The doctrine of God, his Nature, his Perſons, his Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of the Meſſias Chriſt Ieſus, of Iuſtification, of Sanctification, of the Reſurection, &amp;c.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond touching outward orders in the Church, which are truly called &amp; accounted Chriſts own alſo, although particularly deuiſed and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Church, whom Chriſt hath authorized therevnto, euen as it ſhalbe thought moſt fit and profitable for the preſent times, places and perſons: ſuch we hold all outward gouernement and ceremonies to bee, becauſe they be not ſimply of the foundation, neither written, nor certen, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, but at the arbitrarie appoinctment of the Church and Magiſtrate, and yet to be Chriſtes owne neuertheleſſe, who hath left this libertie for the Church to vſe; Thus we hold and thus we practiſe, and wee are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded no Scripture to be againſt all this, but rather for it.

                           <p>COncerning our Second Exception, it was propounded by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, requiring that they would ſhewe vs, if they held Jeſus Christ to be the Prophet, Priest, &amp; King of his Church, to be obeyed in his own ordinances onely and in no other, howe then their practize agreeth with this profeſſion. One would haue thought that here it had bene good and needfull (if they could) to haue cleared this poinct by the Scriptures and the Testament of Christ, and from thence to haue manifested, that their Ministerie, worſhip, ministration, gouernement, &amp;c. which are called
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7940:11"/>in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are no other then the Lord Ieſus Christ, (that Prophet, Prieſt and King of his Church) hath in his Testament giuen and appointed therevnto. And haue they not done this? Surely no. What then doe they ſay? First they tell vs, <hi>That touching this poinct, their profeſſion and practize nowe is ſo as before time it was with M.</hi> Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer <hi>and their Cogregations.</hi> But what of this? Can the perſons or age of thes whom he nameth, nay can anie perſon or ages preiudice the trueth? Were not they ſubiect to error at all? or must their errors binde vs: Did not Iohn Hus (that worthy champion of Christ) and others alſo of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in former times, ſay and heare Maſſe, euen to their dying day, not ſeeing the abomin ations thereof? And did not diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acknowledge, ſome the Popes calling and Supremacie, ſome 7. Sacramentes, ſome Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, ſome Auricular confeſſion, and ſuch like greeuous errours, &amp;c, And yet notwithstanding dyed moſt constantly for the truethes which they ſawe and testified, ſome for one, and ſome for another, as God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the trueth vnto them: As may be ſeene at large in their ſeueral Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories in the Actes and Monumentes, whether wee referre the Reader. But may we nowe ſo profeſſe and practize in theſe things as they did? Or if we ſhould, were their ignorance and errours a ſufficient defence for vs? yet thus would this man beare vs in hande. But moreouer, let him tell vs, if Maister Latimer and others, did not forſake the Prelacie and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had before-time receyued? And Maister Ridley at his death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that he had bene ſo earnest for the remnantes of Poperie in his time retayned? Beſides alſo, who knoweth not, that when Maiſter Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, &amp;c. dyed Martyrs for the trueth of Christ, they neither had them ſelues, nor ioyned in ſpirituall communion with ſuch as had the Prelacie and Maniſterie nowe pleaded for? And not that onely, but were alſo members of that perſecuted church in Queene Maries dayes, which was ſeparated from the rest of the Lande, as from the world, and ioyned in couenaunt, by voluntarie profeſſion, to obey the trueth of Christ, and to witnes against the abominations of Antichrist, As they alſo did euen vnto death, in the trueth which they ſawe, though otherwiſe being but as it were in the twylight of the Gospell they had their wantes and errors. Yet who is ſo blinde or beſotted, as not to ſee that their errours may not bee our rules, neither can be our warrant, but rather that we ought after their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, faithfully to ſtand, in, and for, what ſo euer trueth God reuealeth vnto vs by his word, And that otherwiſe, thoſe holy Martyrs ſhould riſe in iudgement against all ſuch, as either withhould the trueth in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or in any reſpect refuſe to walke therein. Finally, ſeeing GOD hath giuen vs his worde, to be the light of our feete, and rule of our liues and religion: What meane theſe men to lead vs from it, to the aberrations
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7940:12"/>of any men whatſoeuer? Should not all people enquire at God, or would they haue vs goe from the liuing to the dead? From God and his worde to men and their errours? Doubtleſſe this is that whervnto they would bring vs, and whereby they miſlead their followers, as will yet further appeare by that which followeth. For what ſay they next?</p>
                           <p>Secondly, they tell vs, and they wiſhe it to bee noted, (as wee alſo doe) <hi>That Chriſtes ordinances be of two ſortes, either written or vnwritten: the firſt neceſſarie: the ſecond arbitrary: the firſt touching doctrine, that is, touching faith and the inward opinion onely: theſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: the ſecond touching outward orders in the Church, and all outward go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uernement, and ceremonies: Theſe, they ſay, are not written, but arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary at the appointment of the Church and Magiſtrate.

Surely God is iust and will verifie his word, where he ſaieth, "That they which receyue not the loue of the trueth, that they may bee ſaued, hee will ſende them ſtronge deluſions, to beleeue lyes, that they may bee damned. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, note howe he maketh the ordinances touching outwarde gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ceremonies, to be no matters of faith, neither writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all.

Publique prayer, preaching of the Word, and hearing of it preached, administration and receyuing of the Sacraments, are matters concerning the outward gouernement and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church: doe they not therefore touch faith? Admonition and exhortation concerne alſo the outwarde gouernement of the Church, doe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7940:12"/>they not therefore concerne faith? Finally, by this diuinitie, the Sacraments of Baptiſme and of the Lordes ſupper, being ceremonies, ſhalbe no matters of faith at all amongſt them.</p>
                           <p>But here they ſtay not, but adde moreouer, <hi>That the outward orders, gouernement, and ceremonies of the Church, bee arbitrarie at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Church and Magiſtrate, and not certen nor written in the booke of God.</hi> Whervpon it followeth, that it is not certen nor taught in the ſcriptures, but arbitrarie at the Churches &amp; Magistrates pleaſure: Whether Christ, or the Pope of Rome or of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terburie, be head and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of the Church of God: Whether Jewes onely of the tribe of Leui, may nowe minister the holy things of God in his Church: Whether Christ haue giuen any giftes, and ſet any offices in his Church for the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and guidance thereof: Whether prayer must bee in a knowne or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tounge: Whether the teaching and ruling Elders be to be had and honored: Whether the church may excommunicate: Whether the Popes, or any other Prelates excommunication be to be regarded: Whether there be two, or three, or ſeauen Sacramentes: Whether the Paſſeouer, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and other ceremonies and ſacrifices of the Lawe, be now to be vſed: Whether the Heatheniſhe ſacrifices and worſhip be to bee ioyned withall: Whether creame, oyle, ſalt, ſpitle, croſſing and coniuring, be to be vſed in Baptiſme: Whether the bread onely and not the cup, is to bee giuen to the lay people (as they call them:) Whether holy water, holy aſhes, holy palmes and ſuch like, be of the holy things of the church: Whether the Iewiſh and Popiſh vestimentes, faſtes, and holy dayes are to be obſerued: and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande ſuch like, which are all of them, concerning the outward orders, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and ceremonies of the Church. By theſe mens Diuinitie, theſe and infinite ſuch like, are vnwritten and vncerten, but left onely to the pleaſure of the Church and Magistrate. Moreouer, if it pleaſe them, the Princes and ciuill Magiſtrates may them ſelues be the publike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the worde, Sacraments, and cenſures of the Church: any that will may without a calling take vpon him to bee a publique officer in the church: Women may baptiſe, or administer the Lords ſupper: The Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhe, Romiſh, or Heatheniſh priesthood may be retayned: Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion may be vſed: The Keyes of the kingdome of heauen, may bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Pope of Rome, or the Prelate of Canterburie, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom ſoeuer: The Prelates and their Officials excommunications do binde in heauen: The Apochriphall bookes and Decretall epistles are canonicall ſcriptures: The Papes Portuis and the Engliſh booke of prayer taken out of it, are the true and lawfull worſhip of God: The Prelates and Prieſtes are the true and lawfull Ministers of God: Orders, pennaunce, extreame vnction, matrimonie, &amp;c. are the Sacramentes of the Church:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7940:13"/>Cap, Surplis, Cope, Tippit, Rotchet, &amp;c. are ornamentes of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie. Finally, all ragges and trumperies of the Romiſh religion, are good and lawfull, if it pleaſe the Church and Magistrate. For why? They concerne the outward gouernement, orders and ceremonies of the church: And touching them (ſay theſe men) Christ hath not left any ordinances written, certen, or perpetuall, but left them at the arbitrarie appointment of the Church and Magiſtrate. Is not this ſtraunge Diuinitie? Yet they ſtay not there neither, but as men that haue bent their tongues like bowes for lyes, they feare not to adde moreouer, that when the Church and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate appointeth anie ordinances, (whether theſe or any other) touching the outward gouernement &amp; ceremonies of the Church, we are to account them to be Chriſtes owne ordinances, who hath left this libertie to the Church for to vſe. O ſhameles mouth: O vnchristian hart: Can any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist or Atheist ſay more? or can any deſire a more euident proof then this, that theſe men and aſſemblies thus holding, profeſſing, and practizing (as here them ſelues affirme) can not in this estate by the word of God, be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med med true Christians and Churches. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, obſerue howe yet moreouer they ſeeke ſhiftes, &amp; would colour the matter, pretending <hi>That the things which concerne outward gouernement and ceremonies, are not of the foundation ſimply.</hi> But this will helpe them no more then the other. For first we aſke, are they of the foundation at all, though not ſimply? If they be, then ſeeing they are not written, not certen, nor perpetuall (as heere is affirmed) it will followe, that neither the whole foundation is written cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or perpetuall: neither the Apostles were faithfuull and ſkilſull mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter builders in the laying thereof. If they be not, then why is this worde (ſimplie) added, as if they graunted that they were of the foundation, though not ſimplie as they ſpeake. Secondlie wee aſke, whether the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde gouernement and ceremonies ordeyned by Christ for his church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospell, be not of the foundation, aſmuch as the outward gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ceremonies appointed by Moſes for the Church vnder the law? Or if they be, whether they are not as faithfully ſett downe by Christ, as the other were by Moſes, and as carefully to be obſerued by vs, as the other were by the Jewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.2.3.</note> or rather much more, inaſmuch as Chriſt the Son is worthy more glorie and honour, then Moſes the ſeruant. Thirdlie we aſke, what foundamentall poinctes Moſes and Aaron with the rest of the Iewes ioyning with them, helde: that <hi>Corah, Dathan, Abiram,</hi> and their companions held not: Differing from them and erring only touching the Priesthood and Ministerie which concerned the outward orders &amp; gouernement of the Church: was therefore Corah, Dathan, Abiram, and their companies in that estate the true Jſraell of God? Or were not the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7940:13"/>other truthes they helde by this meanes fruſtrate and of none effect vnto them? Nay, were they not therefore wholy to be ſeparated from, and left to the iudgement of God,<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> which ouertooke them and all that ioyned vnto them? Yet was their error onely in matters of order and outward gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. This may ſuffize to conuince the aduerſaries vntrue aſſertions in this place. To that of Maiſter Cranmer and Ridley &amp;c. is anſwered before.</p>
                           <p>For concluſion therefore, this we adde, concerning this poinct. That all ſuch aſſemblies and people, as holde, profeſſe, and practiſe, (as doth the Church of England) theſe abominations following: They can not by the word of God, be esteemed in ſuch eſtate trulie to holde Chriſt, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Priest, and King: Towit, The confuſion of all ſortes of people (though neuer ſo wicked) and their ſeed in the body of the Church: The offices and callings of other Archb. and Lordb. then Ieſus Christ: alſo of Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Officials, Prieſtes, halfe Prieſtes, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icars, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>agrant and Mercinarie Preachers, &amp;c.

The aſſemblies (I ſay) and people which holde, profeſſe, and practize (as doeth this Church of Englande) the abominations afore ſaid, concerning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward order and gouernement of the Church, what ſoeuer truethes they holde beſides, yet can they not by the word of God, be deemed truely to hold the Lord Ieſus, their Prophet, Priest, and King, in ſuch constitution of a church. Neither therefore can they in this estate by the word of God be accounted true Christians, nor the true constituted churches of Christ: &amp; this is the question betweene vs and our aduerſaries. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7.

                           <hi>IN this your defence of your ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Exception, it pitieth me to ſee your extreame folly: which is the more miſerable, becauſe it appeareth to be not of weaknes, but of wilfulnes. You would know of vs</hi> if we hold Chriſt to be our Prophet, Priest and King, and if we profeſſe to obey him in his own ordinances and in no other. <hi>I anſwered, we doe conſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe ſo, and as we profeſſe ſo wee practiſe. But to make our profeſſion &amp; practize in this poinct more manifeſt, I noted how our ſtare meaneth Chriſt to be our Prophet, Prieſt and King, and how hee is to be obeyed viz. That the written word ought of neceſſitie to ſhew vs our inward and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7940:14"/>meare ſpirituall beleif &amp; obedience. As for the outward Church order, our ſtate holdeth that it is arbitrary to bee appoincted and abrogated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at the liking of the Church and Magiſtrate, And that the worde no where forbiddeth this libertie: Where note in this explication two thinges.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt, it is foule wrong to our Churches and to my wordes, to ſay as you doe,</hi> That they meane, no outward orders at all, be matters of faith, or conſtant in the Scriptures. <hi>Nay it was neuer doubted, but to preach, to pray to adminiſter Sacraments &amp;c. though externall, yet are perpetuall things and neceſſarie and vnchangable by the Scriptures. My expreſſe wordes, and our Churches meaning is, That any reaſonable kinde of Church gouernement, and rites, and orders, are arbitrary and changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no matters of faith, nor written in the Scriptures; And yet ſtill Chriſt to be our only, and abſolute King &amp; Prophet neuertheleſſe.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, note in my explication, that I iuſtifie not this opinion of our ſtare, but I ſay, Thus to beleeue and practize,</hi> ſimply, <hi>deſtroyeth no mans ſaluation in Chriſt, which you denying generally and vehemently, in your ſixt anſwer, You deny directly Maiſter</hi> Cranmer, &amp;c. <hi>to haue held the foundation, or to bee ſaued: wherein, you openly profeſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime, that ſecond generall poinct which in the beginning I charged you with: That all Churches and Chriſtians here in Kinge Edwards time, and namely</hi> Maister Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper, Philpot, Saunders, Rogers, Tayler. &amp;c. <hi>held not Chriſt their Prophet, Prieſt and King, and ſo conſequently they were lims of Antichriſt (for they bare his marke euen to their deaths) and no true Chriſtians. Alas to ſee how malice and preiudice hath blinded you. Is there not greater cauſe for vs to cry &amp; ſay againſt you,</hi> O ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe mouth, ô vnchristian heart, <hi>which termes, you vainely charge vpon me? Is this you that white the Toombs of thoſe Martirs, and yet in fine, condempne them for no true Chriſtians, nor their Aſſemblies for Churches?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>You adde a clauſe,</hi> They that profeſſe and practize as doth the Church of England, &amp;c. <hi>If you meane hereby to put a difference, betwene thoſe good mens holding this opinion, and our Churches nowe. Yea betwene your owne lately, and ours now, ſpeake out, what is it? Yow can imagine none but this. Thoſe good men Maiſter</hi> Cranmer, Ridley, &amp;c. <hi>and your ſelfe of late, held theſe very ſame errors of the outward Church order which wee doe; But they and you, did (it ſeemeth) of ſimplicity, we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly: they of ignorance, wee of plaine obſtinacie, and hauing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted and ſeared conſcience: whereby, they &amp; you might be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for all theſe errors, but we now cannot be ſo. If this be your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7940:15"/>then you graunt vs our Aſſumption, againſt which all your diſpute here is bent. You graunt it I ſay, That the whole doctrine, as it is by law in England, is ſufficient to make a perticuler man a true Chriſtian. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> wee now erre not in theſe poincts of ſimplicitie, but of wilfulnes and malice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Say you ſo? Speake that plaine then. Our whole aſſemblies? all and euery of our aſſemblies? of wilfulnes and of a conuicted conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Are you ſure of this? Doe you knowe euery mans heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo well? If you doe, then you ſay ſomwhat indeed. But you are then neere as wiſe as God himſelfe, to know mens hearts ſo perfectly, whoſe faces you neuer ſaw; You will ſay, you know diuers, whom you dare ſay are conuicted in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. That is much alſo to affirme. But if you doe, that ſerueth not your turne, vnleſſe all be ſo conuicted. Chriſt knew a great many in the Church of the</hi> Iewes, <hi>yea of the learnedſt and chiefeſt in authoritie, that were conuicted in conſcience, that he was the Chriſt, who blaſpheamed in denying him, And yet the Aſſemblies then where not conuicted, they ſtill were true Churches. Wherefore in this ſaying, if you ſay to the purpoſe, you then affirme the Third generall poinct that I noted in you at the beginning of this my laſt Reply: That euery ſoule in England is conuicted in conſcience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But here I maruell that you ſay,</hi> Maister Hus and others of the holy Martirs did heare and ſay Maſſe till their dying day, Alſo that others did acknowledge the Popes ſupremacie. <hi>I aſke you, doe you meane that they held and vſed the Popiſh Maſſe, according to all the abominations that are in it? If you thinke ſo, then ſurely neither</hi> Hus, <hi>nor any of the reſt, were</hi> holy <hi>Martirs. For therin are founde errors plainely fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which of them ſelues aboliſh from Chriſt; They are not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our publike errours now in England, The like I ſay of the Popes ſupremacy. If you thinke any of the Martirs acknowledged it in the large and ample meaning therof, as the Popiſh Doctors doe ſet it down; Then verily neither were they any Martirs. The booke of Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents whither you ſend vs, affirmeth not that they held theſe errours in the largeſt and groſſeſt ſort. It may be therefore they held manie and greuious errors of ignorance, both in the Popiſh Maſſe and in the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, which might neuertheleſſe ſtand with Chriſt crucifyed, And ſo they might be &amp; were holy Martirs: But I affirme, that according to the damnable groſſenes of the very Papiſts, they neither did nor could hold them.

                           <p>Now I pray you, haue they ſhewed vs theſe things by the Scriptures, as we deſired: nothing leſſe. First therefore marke this heere and euerie where alſo in their reaſons and anſweres, that though wee call neuer ſo much to them for proofe and euidence from the Scriptures, yet they neuer bring it, but labour to put it off with other ſhiftes &amp; deuices of their owne: As if our conſciences were to be built vpon their fancies, and not vppon the written worde of God. But what doe they ſay to our demaund? First they tell vs, <hi>Theſe thinges doe not vtterly deſtroy true Chriſtianitie.</hi> Secondly, they graunt notwithstanding, that they agree with it as blacke doeth with white, that is, they are cleane contrarie vnto it: For this their ſimilitudes doe import. Nowe whereas they alleadge, <hi>That theſe thinges deſtroy not true Chriſtianitie,</hi> We anſwere, That euen that Hyerarchie, worſhip, constitution, and gouernement, which they profeſſe and practize (as appeareth by thoſe and other their Articles and iniunctions in our former anſwere alleadged, to which yet we haue receyued no aunſwere) being directly Antichristian, doe<note n="*" place="margin">Nota</note> vtterlie deſtroy true Chriſtianitie. ſo as the people and Churches ſo profeſſing and practizing, can not in that eſtate by the worde of God be iudged true Christians, or the true constituted Churches of Christ. And touchinge <hi>the ſimilitudes here vſed,</hi> beſides that which we haue noted before, we adde moreouer, that they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, but againſt them ſelues, in aſmuch as comparing the doctrines of the Goſpell, which they profeſſe, with the whitenes of an Aethiopians teeth: And their Antichristian Ministerie, Worſhop, courtes, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of people, with the blackenes of an Aethiopians body. This and ſuch like ſimilitudes doe fitlie declare their estate. And the approouing of the black constitution of their church Aſſemblies, by ſome white doctrines of the Gospell which they profeſſe: Is euen as if they ſhould reaſon thus: An Aethiopian is white of his teeth: therefore he is a white man. A blacke Rauen is white of his bill: Therefore a blacke Rauen is a white bird.</p>

As alſo comparing theſe and the booke by him alleadged togeather, it may hence appeare that our speach is proper; and fitlie declaring their estate, when we ſaide they ioyne Christ and Antichrist togeather: And therfore his anſwere in this place to be friuolous and of no weight.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Next he commeth to the proofe of our Propoſition, which was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by theſe ſcriptures, <hi>2</hi> Cor. <hi>6.14, 15, 16.</hi> with Ezek. <hi>43.8.</hi> &amp; <hi>2</hi> King, <hi>17 33, 34, 40, 41.</hi> The Propoſition which we proued by theſe Scriptures, was this.</p>
                           <p>That which ioyneth Christ and Antichrist togither, can not make a true Christian.</p>
                           <p>Nowe let euen the aduerſaries them ſelues iudge, Whether theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures doe not ſo euidentlie proue this Propoſition, as none can denie it, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7940:19"/>ſuch as are Wilfully blinded, and ſtriue againſt the light of their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences But what ſaith he of theſe ſcriptures here alleadged? Forſooth <hi>That they are wholy miſmatched.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>Becauſe the ioyninge there forbidden, is vnto ſuch Idolatrie, as can not ſtande by any meanes with Chriſtian faith, and breaketh moſt directlie the Firſt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereas their tranſgreſſion is but againſt the Seconde, and may ſtande with true faith, as he ſuppoſeth in Cranmer, &amp;c.</hi> First, this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of his, concerneth our Aſſumption, whereas thoſe ſcriptures were the profe of the Propoſition. But to let this paſſe, let vs conſider the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere it ſelfe, howe worthy and clerk like it is. <hi>Theſe ſcriptures</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>forbid ioyning to ſuch Idolatrie, as can not ſtande with Chriſtian faith, and breaketh moſt directlie the Firſt commaundement. 1.</hi> Jf this were ſo, what then? Doe they not therfore forbid ioyning to Antichristian ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and that falſe worſhip which breaketh the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement? <hi>2:</hi> Secondlie, he can not denie, but as we iudge of their way and estate, ſo it is a tranſgreſſion against the Second commaundement. Nowe, Samuell ſaith, Rebellion is as the ſinne of witchcraft, and tranſgreſsion is wickednes &amp; idolatry.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19.</note> See then what advantage he getteth by his owne anſwere? <hi>3.</hi> Thirdly, as the Pagans Idolatrie breaking the Firſt commaundement, cannot ſtand with true christian faith, ſo neither can the idolatrie and falſe worſhip of Antichrist breaking the ſeconde. To that of Maister Cranmer, &amp;c, is alreadie anſwered in pag. <hi>13.</hi> wherevnto may bee added, that their caſe nowe, is nothing ſo as theirs was then: both for that they ſuffered to death for the trueth which they ſawe, And becauſe the things nowe controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were not then ſo called into question and conuinced against them by the ſcriptures, as nowe they haue ben against theſe: neither were then by them ſo reſisted and perſecuted as they are by theſe men now adayes, euen vnto bandes, banniſhment, and death it ſelfe: Otherwiſe we might iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the callings and eſtate of the Monkes and Fryars, and of the most Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſtes and Prelates, and the hauing communion with them in that estate, becauſe diuers ſuch haue ben Martirs, and layd downe their liues for the trueth which they ſawe, who yet neuer doubted of the lawfulnes of their callings and estate in this behalfe, which then were not ſo called into queſtion, nor convinced by the ſcriptures, to bee vnlawfull, as ſince they haue bene. <hi>4.</hi> Fourthlie, as there is a double Jdolatrie and falſe worſhip the one against the First commaundement when any haue others beſides the true God for their God: the other against the Second commaundment, when anie hauing the true God for their God, yet worſhip him not as hee hath commaunded, but after the inventions and preſcriptions of men: So alſo theſe ſcriptures alleadged, and the whole courſe of the word of God, condempneth the ioyning and hauing fellowſhip with either of theſe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7940:20"/>this which is againſt the Second commaundement, as that whiche is againſt the Firſt. See the Reaſons alleadged by the Apostle:<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14. &amp;c.</note> Are they not ſtronge and weightie against ioyning togeather righteouſnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes, light and darkneſſe, Christ and Beliall, whether it be in the breach of the Firſt or Second commaundement? Saieth not the Lord there, That his Church is his Temple, in which he dwelleth and Walketh, and therefore requireth of them that they be his people, his ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſeparated from the world, and touching <hi>no vncleane thing:</hi> whether it be of Antichrist against the Second, or of the Heathen against the Firſt commaundement?<note place="margin">Ezech. 43.8.</note> And touching the place of Ezekiell, who ſeeth not, that he ſpeaketh directlie of the breach of the Second commandement, in ioyning togeather in the worſhip of the true God, their threſholdes with Gods threſholds, and their poſtes with Gods poſtes, that is, their inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Gods ordinances: which though it bee done to the name and for the ſeruice of the true God, yet ſayth the Prophet, Jt is abomination in the ſight of God, and they that doe ſo worſhip him, ſet a wall betweene God &amp; them ſelues, and defyle his holy Name with their abominations. Loe here the vſe and fruict of ioyning togeather the inuentions of men (chieflie of Antichrist that man of ſinne) with the ordinances of God in his worſhipp and ſeruice. As Maister Iacob and his complices like this, ſo let them holde on in pleading for it, and practizing of it. The third place allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, is out of <hi>2</hi> King. <hi>17.</hi> where alſo it is most plaine,<note place="margin">2 King. 17.</note> that the ſcripture ſpeaketh of the breach of the Second co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. For there is ſet down that the Samaritans worſpipped the <note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 28.32 41.</note> ſame God, and after, <note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 26.27, 29, 33, 34, 40.</note> the ſame manner that the Iſraelites of the Tenne Tribes did, that were carryed from thence: That is, they worſhipped the<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 28.32 41.</note> true God, but<note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 26.27, 29, 33, 34, 40.</note> not as hee had commaunded, but by hauing Images of ſundrie ſortes, by whiche they thought God was repreſented, as<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 32, 4.</note> of olde they thought of the calfe that Aaron made, and by other inuentions deuiſed by the Iſraelites in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ioyned to Gods ordinances for the worſhip and ſeruice of him. That this was the ſinne of thoſe Samaritans against the Second comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, will appeare, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring togeather with this chapter, theſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures following, to which we referre the Reader, Ezra <hi>4.1, 2.</hi> with Exod. <hi>20.4, 5, 6.</hi> and <hi>32.1, 4, 5, 6.</hi> Jug. <hi>17.2, 3, 4, 5, 13</hi> Ezek <hi>20.39.</hi> Hoſea <hi>2.16.</hi> Amos <hi>5.21, 22, 23.</hi> &amp; <hi>8.14. 1</hi> Kings <hi>12.27.</hi> and <hi>18.21.</hi> and <hi>21.29.</hi> and <hi>22.12, 24.</hi> Eſay <hi>10.11.</hi> Iohn <hi>4.19, 20, 25, 26, 29, 30.</hi> By theſe alſo, as by that of Ezekiell likewiſe may appeare, howe falſe it is, that hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, <hi>They did not ſo much as profeſſe the written law to be their rule, neither for outwarde order, nor their inwarde doctrines of faith.</hi> Jf this were ſo, howe could it bee true, which Ezechiell ſayeth of them, of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7940:20"/>whom he ſpeaketh, that they ſet their poſtes and threſhalls by Gods postes and Treſhalls, that is, their inuentions by Gods ordinances. Howe alſo was it that the Samaritans, spoken of <hi>2</hi> King. <hi>17.</hi> ſacrificed to the true God, euen the Lord God of the Iewes, offering vnto him burnt offringes, and meate offringes, and peace offringes?

But for the more euidence of the trueth, we will ſet downe the proofe of the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Sillogiſme, thus:</p>
                           <p>If a Galatian ſubmitt to Circumciſion, though he hold all the truthes of the Gospell profeſſed in England withall, yet be notwithstandinge aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from Christ, and falne from grace, Then is he not in this estate a true Christian.</p>

The question is not, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Galatians were true Christians, or any of their Aſſemblies, true chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For who euer doubted of that? But this is the question: Whether a Galatian holding all the truethes of the Gospell nowe profeſſed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, and withall ſubmit to Circumciſion, were in that estate a true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7940:25"/>Or putting the caſe that there were whole Aſſemblies conſisting of ſuch: Whether thoſe aſſemblies then in that caſe were by Gods worde to be deemed the true churches of Christ.

                        <p>I deny the Propoſition. The Samaritans, might knowe by hearſay and beleeue, the Meſſias ſhould come, and Baalam did know it, Nom. 24.17. and the Deuils doe now know and beleue, Iam. 2.17. Yet none of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued [in] him. It followeth not therefore, that they were as nigh ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as wee of England. In a worde, there is a Reaſon manifeſt. Theſe Samaritans ioyned Heatheniſh Idols with the God of Iſrael. 2.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7940:32"/>that I anſwer nothing againſt it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt I ſay, there you ſophiſticate againe. And it ſeemeth you can doe nothing elſe in argumentation. For your Propoſition is Aequiuocall and ambiguous. If you meane they that worſhip God after a falſe manner, that is totally, or els Fundamentally. Then I cleerely graunt it, and that the Samaritans doe proue the ſame, ſeeing they erred Fundamentally. But your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption touching vs, is then vtterly falſe. You bring not a ſillable or one letter, to proue either of theſe Two againſt vs, in all your writing, neither can you, but bare begging of the controuerſie which is infinite ofte. If you meane in your Propoſition, They that ſerue God after a falſe maner, that is, in part, not Wholly nor Fundamentally, As namely in the Hyerarchy and externall ceremonies as Cranmer, &amp;c. Then I ſay and avouch confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the preſence of God, that ſuch may be true Chriſtians, though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in many things. Yea infinite, ſuch haue bene, are, and may bee hereafter, true Chriſtians. The contrarie whereof, is no leſſe then horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaſphemie againſt God and his Saincts, wherfore your Propoſition, is ſhewed to be againe ſophiſticall, as alſo thoſe were in your Third Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and Firſt and Second Reaſons.</p>
                        <p>Secondly where you ſay, <hi>the Samaritans proue it, and I ſay nothing againſt it.</hi> Marke you. Firſt I ſaid, the Samaritans might knowe by hearſay, and yet not faithfully beleeue [in] the Meſſias. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ignorant, that there is a great difference betweene an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure rumor, which ſome of them might receiue from their neighbour Iewes, and yet not haue it conſtantly beleeued, and held publiquely among them, as their comon faith. If thus the <hi>Samaritans</hi> beleeued the comming of <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> they are in no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon with vs, we holde our moſt holy faith and doctrine by the worde profeſſedly, as the publique ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of our Churchs ſheweth. But furder let it be howſoeuer they held the comming of <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> yet I anſwered, The <hi>Samaritans</hi> ioyned Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Idols with the God of Iſraell which wholly deſtroyed the trueth in them. And this is the very truth indeed, howſoeuer you will not yeld it. For you ſay, <hi>that they broke not the Firſt commaundement, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped not the Jdols them ſelues, nor ſacrifiſed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> This is proued apparantly falſe in the Text 2.

For the men of Babel made Succoth-Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergall, and the men of Hamath made Aſhima. And the Auims made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharuims burnt their children in the fyer to Adramelch &amp; Anammelech the Gods of Sepharuim: Therfore they worſhipped the Idols of the Heathen, and ſacrifiſed to them, and accoumpted them to be Gods aſwell as the God of Iſraell. And ſo broke the Firſt commandement, and therefore they touch not vs in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, As the like I haue truely and well derlared before,<note n="“" place="margin">pag. 34.</note> againſt your Firſt Reaſon.<note place="margin">

(1) That of Ezra. 4.1.2. <hi>that they ſought the Lord as the Jewes did, &amp;c,</hi> was their conterfet hypocriſie and falſe brag, yea their diueliſh conſpiracie againſt the worſhip of the Iewes God. Doe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7940:32"/>you beleeue their wordes here in this place, that they are true indeed? I graunt as I noted before out of 2. Kings 17. they had a mixed worſhip, ſome thing of the Iewes God, but very much and (as by that Chapter ſeemeth) moſt of the Heathens Gods. 2. Secondly,<note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> where you ſay out of Iohn. 4. <hi>That it is manifeſt, there was no contention betweene the Jewes and the Samaritans, whether</hi>

                           <hi>only the true God was to be worſhipped.</hi> There appeareth no word of any ſuch thing, Our Sauiour indeed noteth verſ. 21. One difference betwene them, that was, but about the place of worſhipping on occaſion of the womans wordes: But that there was no difference betwene them in the obſeruing of the Firſt Commandement, he ſaith not. The contrarie you ſaw before proued in 2. King. 17.30.31.3. Thirdly you vrge my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion, <hi>That the Iſralites vnder Ieroboam ſerued not Pagan Jdols but the true God after their owne deuices. And you would proue it too, by</hi> 2, <hi>King.</hi> 17.28, 32, 33. <hi>Seeing the Samaritans worſhipped after the manner of the nations that dwelt there before they came, who were the Tenne tribes that Ieroboam drew away.</hi> I aunſwere, Firſt it is great ſhame, that you make this my confeſſion, when I expreſly bring it in, as your Obiection, whervnto I ſet mine anſwer,<note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> that the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry vnder <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ſeemeth farre groſſer and filthier then the worſt is with vs, which I make manifeſt by the ſcripture, not only 1. King. 12.21. where <hi>Ieroboam</hi> erected viſible Idols, and very filthy ones, euen calues and brute beaſtes: which if they were but to worſhip God by, yet who would compare our Eccleſiaſticall orders to them, which<note n="*" place="margin">Viz. the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſtate.</note> we profeſſe are but indifferent thinges, for order and comelineſſe only. Further I alleadged 2. Chro. 11.15. Where <hi>Ieroboam</hi> is ſaid to appoinct Prieſtes, for the high places, for <hi>Deuils,</hi> and for the Calues that he made. So I confeſſe little to your aduantage. Secondly, if the <hi>Samaritans</hi> worſhipped (as they did indeed) like the Tenne tribes before them, then you are cleane gone. For though <hi>Ieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           </hi> at the Firſt had not ioyned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heatheniſh Idolatry. Yet <hi>Ahab</hi> did 1. King. 16.32, 33. and his Sonne <hi>Ahaziah</hi> had further <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron.</hi> Yea the Iſralites, as they of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> afterwardes, were Idolaters much a like 2. King. 17.19. But wee read of the Iewes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Ahas</hi> 2 Chr. 28.23. and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Amon.</hi> 2 King. 21. and 23.4, 5, 10, 11.12, 13. That they vſed the very Pagans Idolatrie. Yea it is expreſſed, 2. King. 17.8, 11, 16, 17. That theſe Tenne Tribes vſed the very ſame. Therefore the Samaritans doing as theſe Iſralites did,<note place="margin">Pag. 54.</note> held ſuch groſſe idolatry as could by no meanes ſtand with the true ſeruing of God. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as before is noted 2. King. 17.29, 30, 31. doeth expreſſe this groſſe Heatheniſh idolatrie of the Samaritans. Surely it appeareth more groſſe and worſe then the Iſralites before them. And therefore you are greatly deceiued both here &amp; in the defence of your Firſt Reaſon before:<note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> where you expreſlie mainteine <hi>theſe Samaritans to holde no Heatheniſh Jdola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, but onely to cleaue to the God of Jſraell in an outwarde deuiſed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt worſhip.</hi> They acknowledged him, I graunt, but him only I denie, as hath ben proued.</p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:7940:33"/>
                        <p>Further you affirme in your defence of your Firſt Reaſon,<note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> 
                           <hi>That they profeſſed the written lawe to be the rule, both for their inward beliefe, and outward manner of worſhip.</hi> Where you would proue it <hi>For that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate Iſraelites did ſo of whom Ezeck. speaketh.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Zeck. 43.8.</note> Firſt this followeth not, becauſe the Heatheniſh Samaritans were further from ſinceritie, then the naturall Iſraelites commonly. Secondly, Iſraell it ſelfe in this wretched Apoſtaſie, helde not the written law for their rule, ſeeing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedlie they left this rule, and did conſtantlie worſhip Calues, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fized at Dan and Bethel. Thirdly, Ezekiell ſheweth, euen there, cap. 43.7.8. they kept not this rule, but departed therefrom, and that as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth profeſſedly, and conſtantly. Which moſt of all is ſeene in Ahab, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziah, Ahas,<note place="margin">Pag. 34. 55.</note> Manaſſes, and Amon, as is before noted. Wherfore in theſe your ſayings Maiſter <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> you are intollerably too blame and foully deceaued. As for example, They profeſſed that which they did in 2. Kinges. 17.29, 30, 31. was that after the rule of the written Lawe?</p>
                        <p>Next you oppugne me, for that I alleadged our Aſſemblies throughout England,<note place="margin">Pag. 52.</note> haue not their conſciences conuicted in the Hyerarchy and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, you ſay "<hi>if this were ſo, is it any iuſt defence of your miniſtery, worſhip, eſtate, &amp;c.</hi> I tell you it is a iuſt defence for our miniſterie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and eſtate to be as touching the <hi>ſubstance</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſound and acceptable to God. Refute it if you can. I knowe it is no iuſt defence of our whole Miniſtery, eſtate, &amp; manner of worſhip, which I neuer intended, much leſſe profeſſed to iuſtifie.</p>
                        <p>Where you would ſnatch at an advauntage about Aarons line, my meaning was, that they of Aaron were only for Prieſts, &amp; their bretheren of Leui, only for Leuites.</p>
                        <p>But you paſſe this, and you ſet your ſelf in earneſt, <hi>to proue vs all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted in conſcience aboute our Hyerarchie and ceremonies.</hi> So that here you auouch openly, that third generall poinct which I obſerued in my very beginning aboue,<note place="margin">pag. 3.</note> for the which you haue this Reaſon. <hi>Haue not wee the ſcriptures as much as the Apoſtate Iſralites had? Or did not Chriſt as fully and plainly ſett downe our miniſterie and worſhip in the Goſpell, as Moſes in the Law?</hi> I aunſwere, this is true, as touching the word it ſelfe. In the Goſpell we are taught as plainly and as fully for the word it ſelfe, as the Iewes were in Moſes: But it is not yet ſo playne for our vnderſtanding and vſe. Why? Becauſe wee haue had a diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the<note n="“" place="margin">The Paſtors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Churches ſince, haue had many corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions mixed in their callings, they haue not bene pure and ſimple euer ſince: or at leaſt wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proue it otherwiſe, by any recordes now extant.</note> ſimple offices of Paſtours, Teachers and Elders for the ſpace of a Thouſand Three hundreth, or a Thouſand Four hundreth Yeares, and a continuance of the Prelacie all this while hetherto. Alſo, for that many auncient, and late learned, and Godly Chriſtians, haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued it, at leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, if not neceſſary in the Church. And they haue expounded the Scriptures ſo, that they carry no ſmall ambiguity in this matter, in infinite Thouſands iudgement. Thus it hath pleaſed God in his prouidence, to ſuffer this miſtaking amongeſt Chriſtians, thus longe, and thus vniuerſally. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that infinite Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7940:33"/>conſciences are not eaſely conuicted, though they bee miſtaken in this caſe. With the Iewes it was not ſo in this matter that we talke of. As Moſes and the Prophets were moſt plain, that Ieruſalem muſt be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie place of ſolemne worſhip, Arons line the onely Prieſts, no Calues, nor any viſible kinde of Image or meanes to worſhip God in: So alſo they conſtantly and perpetually practized that courſe, euen from Moſes till the Apoſtacie of Ieroboam. When any ſqared from this courſe, theſe were not onely rebuked expreſlie by Gods voyce in his Prophets, from time to time: but alſo the obſtinate, were moſt fearfully ſmitten with Gods miraculous hand from heauen. So that for any to offend in theſe poinctes as Ieroboam did, It could not poſſible bee but in preſumptuous rebellion, with a high hand againſt God, and with a conuicted &amp; ſeared conſcience. Which I ſay cannot with any ſhew of ſence, be ſaid of many Thouſand Chriſtians in this caſe touching the Praelacie, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Further you vrge * theſe Reaſons <hi>That this cauſe hath bene made manifest to the conſciences of men,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 53.</note> 
                           <hi>yea to the Parliament of late times.</hi> You ſay well to the conſciences of men: but not to the conſciences of all men, or the moſt men throughout the land. Yea or to the moſt of them that know and feare God, according to the religion now maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, This is the very queſtion. If you meane ſo, that all mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are conuicted in this matter, All men ſurely will either pitty your ſimplicitie, or laugh at your folly. I pray you Maiſter <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> conſider your ſelfe, you were a true Chriſtian, longe before you fell into this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Yea moreouer you were learned, yea you knew and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged theſe very corruptions a great while, and yet condemned vs not, Nay you condemned the ſeparation earneſtly. I pray you is it not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that numbers, who ſee not ſo farre as you did then, ſhould ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne your ſeparation, and yet be true Chriſtians, as you acknowledge that your ſelfe then was? <hi>meipſo teſte.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That which you ad "of <hi>perſecuting vnto bandes, exile and death</hi> to proue our vtter aboliſhing from Chriſt generally: It is a toy.<note place="margin">Pag. ibid.</note> Firſt if you were meerely innocent, yet this could not make vs worſe then the Iewes in Chriſtes time: who for all that they perſecuted, yet were they not wholly falne from God.

It is therefore not Chriſtes Croſſe in that regard, but your owne that you beare.</p>
                        <p>Finally let it bee noted, if here in this your 6. Reaſon you bee not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to your ſelf, as I haue obſerued in your 2.

Forſooth this: <hi>That they which doe ſo, doe not departe from the faith</hi> totally, <hi>and that the Apoſtles meaning is, that in theſe poincts they departe from the faith, but not abſolutely and wholy.</hi> So by this mans conceite, none may be accounted departers from the faith, that depart only in ſome poinctes, but they which doe it totally from all. And thus then may no heretikes or Antichristes that euer haue bene, or ſhalbe in the worlde, be iudged departers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith, becauſe they departe from it but in ſome poinctes, and not abſolutely from all.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7940:36"/>with caſe, and tyme with tyme, and the eſtate of theſe people and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of England, wilbee found farre more grieuous, as we haue already ſhewed both in the defence of our Second Exception before, and in<note n="i" place="margin">In the anſwer to Maſter Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſam, and in the 9.

                           <p>To conclude this poinct, if their Abominations in England were farre fewer then they are, yet ſo longe as they reteyne that poyſonfull leauen of their Hyerarchie and worſhip, wee must tell them as the Scripture ſaith, and experience teacheth: That<note n="“" place="margin">2.

                           <p>Now in the next place, fearing belike that the euidence of the ſcripture we alleadged, could not by theſe ſhiftes of his be auoyded, but that still the reaſon deducted from thence ſtood ſtrong against them, as we haue ſhewed it doeth: therefore he would haue vs now paſſe by them, and not apply this ſcripture to them,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> or their mother Church of Rome, but vnderstand it of Martion the heretike, and Tatianus, of whom he ſaith, <hi>that they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie condemning mariage and certen meates, might indeed euen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wholie fall from the faith, ſomewhat like to Baalam, Iudas, and thoſe Apoſtate Iſraelites lately ſpoken of, namely for hauing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences conuicted and ſeared with an whote iron: And thus</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>are they in no compariſon with them of England:</hi> Well, But first if his former anſwer were of any weight, it might be asked, why then the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Martion and Tatianus, might not likewiſe haue defended them thus, &amp; ſaid, that their departure from the faith, was but in ſome poincts, not wholy from all? Secondly we anſwer, that if this ſcripture was verified as he graunteth) in Martion and Tatianus, for their condemning of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and meates, then we must needes alſo thinke it verified in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe whoore, and her apoſtate children, whiche are falne into the verie ſinnes, that are heere mentioned. Teh Apostle mentioneth Martion and Tatianus, no more then he doeth the whooriſh Babilon, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of her Fornication: but comprehendeth heere all ſuch who ſo euer they be, as ſhall fall into this Apostaſie.</p>
                           <p>Nowe moreouer, if the<note n="“" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.1, 2, 3.</note> wordes of this ſcripture be duely weighed, &amp; either other ſcriptures, or the estate of the Romiſh Harlott and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren compared therewith, it wilbe founde as liuely to deſcribe theſe, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Martion or any other that euer were in the world. First when the Apostle ſayeth, that this ſhalbe in the latter tymes, who ſeeth not that it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7940:36"/>doeth moſt directly poinct at the Romiſh whoore, though we doubt not, but Martion alſo and Tatianus, which liued twelue hundreth yeares ſince, or thereabouts, may alſo be comprehended therein. Secondly, when it is ſaide, they ſhall departe from the faith, thereby ſignifying that once they held the faith, howe plaine is this of the Romiſh harlot, which in the<note n="“" place="margin">Rom. 1.7.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time was the beloued ſpouſe of God, and ſince is falne into Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and become the Mother of whoredomes and abominations of the earth, as the<note n="*" place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.3. and Reu. 17.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> ſcriptures in other places witneſſeth. Thirdly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid, they ſhall giue heede to ſpirits of errour, and doctrines of Deuils, how fitly agreeth this to the Romiſh Babilon which (as the ſcripture els<note n="“" place="margin">Reu. 18.2.</note> where teſtifieth) is become the habitation of Deuils, and the hold of all foule ſpirits? Fourthly when it is ſaid, they ſhall ſpeake lies through hypocriſie (not to recken vp the infinite particulars that might be alleadged for proof hereof) how fitly doth this deſcribe the Religion and practiſe of the man of ſinne (the Romiſh Antichriſt) which the ſcripture<note n="*" place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.7.</note> els where calleth a miſtery of iniquitie: as pretending to be with and for Chriſt, and to draw men vnto him, when indeed it is oppoſed againſt and exalted aboue the Lord Ieſus Christ, and all his holy ordinances. Fiftly, when it is ſaid, they ſhall haue their conſciences ſeared with an whote iron, how true is this found vpon the throane of the Beaſt, &amp; his Kingdome, concerning which, the ſcripture alſo teſtifieth in<note n="“" place="margin">Reu. 16.10.11.</note> another place that when the vials of Gods wrath ſhalbe powred out vpon them, and they conuinced of their impieties and obominations, they ſhalbe ſo farre from acknowledging and forſaking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they ſhal gnaw their to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues for ſorrow, &amp; rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wil forſak their wickednes, ſhall<note n="*" place="margin">Let their ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, edictes, articles, iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, finallie their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all oppoſitions and madnes againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth and people of God, be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of all this.</note> fight againſt God and his truth, blaſpheaming the God of heauen for their paines &amp; for their ſores, &amp; not repenting of their workes. Lo here a ſeared conſcience in the beaſtes kingdome. Finally, when the Spirit of God here giueth two particular inſtances of his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie. <hi>1.</hi> The forbidding of Mariage, <hi>2.</hi> And the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding to abſtaine from meates, which God hath created to be receiued with thankeſgiuing. How directly doeth he in both theſe, as it were with the finger, poinct at the Romiſh Babilon and her daughters? Jn the one, that is, the forbidding of mariage, when as the Romiſh Babilon forbiddeth it to Prieſts, Friers, Nunnes, and ſuch like, and the Engliſh her daughter, to fellowes of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and prentiſes, and both of them, to all men and women in Lent, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, Rogation weeke, &amp;c. Jn the other, that is, the forbidding of meates created of God to bee receiued with thankeſgiuing, when as both of them, commaund to abſtaine from fleſh, on their ſaincts eues, Emberdayes, Lent, Fridayes, and Satterdayes, throughout the yeare.</p>
                           <p>Thus then we haue ſhewed that this ſcripture (which hee would turne
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7940:37"/>ouer to Martion and Tatianus) doth moſt fitly agree vnto, and most plainly deſcribe the Romiſh Apoſtacy, whether wee apply it to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate, or compare this and other ſcriptures togeather, ſpeaking of the ſame Apoſtacy and defection. By this alſo which hath bone ſaid, it may appeare, that as he ſaith of Martion and Tatianus, that they might be ſaid wholy to fall from the faith ſomewhat like to Balaam, Iudas, and thoſe apostate Iſraelites lately spoken of, namely for hauing their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences conuicted and ſeared with an whot iron: So alſo it is verified, and may be ſaid of the Romiſh Babilon and her daughters. Touching which poinct of their conuicted conſciences, as alſo of the Apostate Iſraelites in particuler, compared with them of Englande, ſee moreouer what is ſaide before in defence of the ſixt Reaſon at the end thereof.</p>
                           <p>Now if ſeeing the euidence of this<note n="“" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1, 2, 3.</note> ſcripture, ſo full &amp; plaine againſt them (as hath bene declared) he would except, that ſo it is in the Romiſh Church, but not in theirs of Englande: First by this meanes he would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe his owne anſwere here, which hath denied it, of the popiſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of meates and marriages, and would turne it ouer from them to Martion and Tatianus: Secondly, this would not hinder but that the conſequent of our Propoſition and the Aſſumption alſo were good, and therefore the Argument ſtrong and of force. Thirdly, the particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, (being founde in their Church of Englande) will testifie it alſo, to be verified of them. Lastlie, although many of the abominations of the whoores cup of Babilon be nowe cast out of England, (for which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we prayſe God) yet ſo long as they reteyne the Hyerarchie,<note place="margin">Reue. 17.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> Stinted Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, confuſion of people, Canons, Excommunications, &amp;c. deriued vnto them from that mother of whoredomes and abominations of the earth, wee must needes beleeue and alleadge against them the ſcripture and common prouerbe which ſayth?<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.44.</note>

                           <hi>Secondly, doeth it follow by my words, as you affirme,</hi> That none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from the faith but thoſe that departe totally, wholy, and abſolutely, whereby all the vildeſt Heretikes ſhould be iustified, as Arrians, Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Anabatiſts, &amp;c. <hi>Doe I ſay ſo? Is this alſo your conſcience? Againe doe I ſay,</hi> The text doth not reproue all the Papiſts in their forbidding of Mariage and Meates, but only Martion and Tatianus of old? <hi>Doe I ſay any ſuch thing? Nay, ſay I not expreſlie the contrarie? Are you then a man of conſcience? Doe you ſuffer for conſcience? Know therefore that this I ſay, and my wordes before doe import ſo much. That whoſoeuer doe forbid mariage or meates, doe depart from the faith. But note: ſome doe more, ſome leſſe. There are ſome that doe ſimply and fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and others in ſome ſorte. Men departe from the faith Simply and Fundamentally two wayes. Firſt they which doe erre in ſuch maine poincts as doe vtterly aboliſh vs from Chriſt and deſtroy the Fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation: thus doe Arrians, Manichees, Seruetus, Papiſtes, &amp;c. Secondly, ſuch as holding the Foundation in doctrine ſound, doe deſperatly profeſſe and teach ſome what els, againſt the manifeſt light that is in them: ſo Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Tatianus, doe Fundamentally and ſimply fall from the faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſimply forbid thoſe good ordinances of God, Marriage and Meates, euen againſt the light of conſcience &amp; nature: togeather where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, a liuely ſauing faith cannot poſſibly ſtand. Now the Papiſts in this do departe from the faith alſo, but that is only in ſome ſorte or in parte: becauſe they forbid theſe things (not abſolutly, but) vnto ſome, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. They that departe thus from the faith, may bee true Chriſtians notwithſtanding, yea they are certenly, if they be no worſe in any thing els, albeit you deny it here moſt fondly &amp; without all ſence.
